# Welcome

Thanks for using this API.

## Getting Started

This project is a NodeJs Express-apollo-server Graphql API.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Clone repository

Start by cloning the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JIdayyy/2109-wns-remote1-yellowteam-back
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd 2109-wns-remote1-yellowteam-back
yarn install
yarn run dev
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `yarn install` command installs all the dependencies you need to run your site.

The `yarn run dev` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.
